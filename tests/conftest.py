                "content": 'By Medha Singh (Reuters) -Over-the-counter (OTC) shares of Fannie Mae (OTC: FNMA ) and Freddie Mac (OTC: FMCC ) rose on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was working on taking the housing giants public. "I am working on TAKING THESE AMAZING COMPANIES PUBLIC, but I want to be clear, the U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES, and I will stay strong in my position on overseeing them as President," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social late on Tuesday. The Trump administration wants to end the long-standing conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been under the U.S. government’s control since 2008 after they suffered heavy losses during the subprime mortgage crisis. Trump had tried to reduce government control during his first term. At a Fannie Mae news conference, Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said Trump is talking about "potentially figuring out how these businesses can continue to be worth more and more money over time." "These businesses, in my view are worth - eventually, will be worth - trillions of dollars worth of value to the American taxpayers," he said. Asked about details of the plan on taking the companies public, Pulte said it’s up to Trump and he would "eventually make whatever decision that he wants to make, on his own timeline." The regulator is expected to play a central role in any effort to return the pair, which backs the majority of the nation’s residential mortgages, to the private sector. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . Fannie shares rose 3.7% to $10.92, while Freddie gained 7% to $8.13 by midday trading after a double-digit jump earlier in the session. The shares, which don’t trade on major exchanges, hit their highest since 2008 after Trump said last week he was mulling a spinoff of the U.S. mortgage finance firms. The United States Treasury owns preferred shares in the firms and warrants to purchase about 80% of their common stock. The combined market value of the two companies was $17 billion as of the last closing price. They have shot up more than five-fold in value over the past year, with most gains made around Trump’s 2024 U.S. election win. Trump ally Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management is the biggest holder of Fannie’s public OTC shares with about 10%, according to LSEG data. Capital Research Global Investors, a unit of the Capital Group, is among the top investors in Freddie and Fannie. Fannie Mae announced an AI fraud detection technology partnership with Palantir (NASDAQ: PLTR ) on Wednesday and said it was in talks with Elon Musk-owned xAI as well. The mortgage fraud detection software will be trained on Fannie Mae data, and Palantir will comply with the company’s controls, Fannie Mae CEO Priscilla Almodovar said.

                "content": "Palantir Technologies Inc . (NYSE:NASDAQ: PLTR ), now commanding a substantial market capitalization of $291 billion, has emerged as a frontrunner in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, with its data analytics platforms gaining significant traction across government and commercial sectors. The company’s recent financial performance and strategic positioning have garnered attention from investors and analysts alike, prompting a closer examination of its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats in an increasingly competitive landscape. According to InvestingPro data, the stock has delivered an impressive 487% return over the past year, highlighting strong investor confidence in its AI-driven growth strategy. Strong Financial Performance Fuels Optimism Palantir’s financial results for the first quarter of 2025 have exceeded expectations, showcasing the company’s ability to capitalize on the growing demand for AI-powered solutions. Total revenue reached $883.9 million, representing a 39% year-over-year increase and surpassing consensus estimates by 2.5%. This growth was primarily driven by robust performance in the US commercial and government sectors. InvestingPro analysis reveals the company has maintained a strong 33.45% revenue growth rate over the last twelve months, with analysts projecting 36% growth for fiscal year 2025. The US commercial segment has been a particular bright spot for Palantir, achieving a $1 billion annual run rate with an impressive 71% year-over-year growth. This acceleration in the commercial sector underscores the increasing adoption of Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) among enterprises seeking to leverage advanced analytics and AI capabilities. Meanwhile, the government sector continues to be a strong contributor to Palantir’s success, with US government revenue increasing by 45% year-over-year to $373.0 million. The company’s deep-rooted relationships with government agencies and its ability to secure high-value contracts have been instrumental in maintaining this growth trajectory. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . Profitability Metrics Show Improvement Alongside its revenue growth, Palantir has demonstrated significant improvements in profitability metrics. The company reported an adjusted operating margin of 44% for the first quarter of 2025, exceeding consensus expectations. This margin expansion reflects Palantir’s ability to scale its operations efficiently while investing in product development and market expansion. InvestingPro data shows an impressive gross profit margin of 80.01%, placing Palantir among the top performers in the software industry. The company’s strong financial health is further evidenced by its comfortable liquidity position, with a current ratio of 6.49 indicating ample resources to meet short-term obligations. Free cash flow generation has also been robust, with the company guiding for between $1.600 billion and $1.800 billion in free cash flow for the full year 2025. This strong cash flow position provides Palantir with the financial flexibility to pursue strategic initiatives and invest in future growth opportunities. Raised Guidance Reflects Confidence In light of its strong performance, Palantir has raised its full-year 2025 revenue guidance to a range of $3.890 billion to $3.902 billion, up from the previous guidance of $3.740 billion to $3.760 billion. This upward revision implies a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 36% at the midpoint, signaling management’s confidence in the company’s growth prospects. The revised guidance also includes an increase in the expected US commercial growth rate to 68% year-over-year, up from the previous projection of 54%. This adjustment highlights the accelerating adoption of Palantir’s solutions in the private sector and the company’s success in expanding its customer base beyond its traditional government focus. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . AI Strategy Drives Growth and Innovation At the heart of Palantir’s success is its strategic focus on artificial intelligence. The company’s AIP offering has gained significant traction, driving rapid customer adoption and revenue growth. Palantir’s ability to quickly establish production use cases with customers through AI boot camps and AIP initiatives has been a key differentiator in the market. Analysts note that Palantir’s AI capabilities position the company as a potential major player in the software industry, drawing comparisons to established giants like Oracle (NYSE: ORCL ) and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ). The company’s first-mover advantage in secure AI platforms and its ability to deliver tangible business outcomes have contributed to its strong market position. International Expansion Presents Challenges and Opportunities While Palantir has experienced remarkable success in the US market, its international performance has been mixed. The company faced challenges in Europe, with some analysts noting structural differences and a lack of understanding of AI technology as potential barriers to adoption. However, strategic partnerships, such as those with NATO and the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), are expected to enhance Palantir’s presence in European markets. The company’s focus on expanding its international footprint remains a key area of interest for investors and analysts. As Palantir continues to refine its go-to-market strategies and adapt its offerings to local market needs, the potential for international growth could become a significant driver of future revenue. Valuation Concerns Temper Bullish Outlook 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . Despite Palantir’s strong financial performance and strategic positioning, concerns about the company’s valuation persist among some analysts. The stock’s high multiples relative to peers and the broader software sector have led to cautious stances from several firms. InvestingPro analysis indicates the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value, with a P/E ratio of 497x and significant volatility (Beta of 2.68). For deeper insights into Palantir’s valuation metrics and comprehensive analysis, investors can access the full Pro Research Report, available exclusively to InvestingPro subscribers. Palantir trades at approximately 75x enterprise value to sales for 2025 estimates and 60x for 2026 estimates, according to some analysts. This premium valuation reflects high expectations for continued growth and market leadership, but also raises questions about the potential for future returns and the company’s ability to sustain its current growth rates. Bear Case Can Palantir maintain its growth rates as it scales? One of the primary concerns for Palantir is whether it can sustain its impressive growth rates as the company continues to scale. As the base of revenue grows larger, maintaining high percentage growth becomes increasingly challenging. Some analysts argue that the law of large numbers may eventually catch up with Palantir, leading to a deceleration in growth rates. Additionally, the company’s heavy reliance on large government contracts and a relatively concentrated customer base could pose risks to consistent growth. Any shifts in government spending priorities or loss of key customers could have a significant impact on Palantir’s revenue trajectory. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . Is the high valuation justified given competitive risks? Palantir’s premium valuation has raised eyebrows among some analysts who question whether it accurately reflects the company’s long-term prospects and potential risks. The software and data analytics market is highly competitive, with both established players and innovative startups vying for market share. As AI technology becomes more widespread and accessible, Palantir may face increased competition from companies offering similar solutions at potentially lower price points. This competitive pressure could impact Palantir’s ability to maintain its current margins and growth rates, potentially leading to a correction in its valuation multiples. Bull Case How much upside potential remains from AI adoption? Proponents of Palantir argue that the company is still in the early stages of capitalizing on the AI revolution. As more enterprises and government agencies recognize the value of AI-powered analytics, Palantir’s addressable market could expand significantly. The company’s proven track record in delivering complex AI solutions positions it well to capture a substantial share of this growing market. Furthermore, Palantir’s continuous innovation in AI technology, as evidenced by its AIP platform, could lead to new use cases and revenue streams. As AI becomes increasingly integral to business operations across industries, Palantir’s expertise and first-mover advantage could translate into sustained growth and market leadership. Can Palantir expand successfully in international markets? While Palantir has faced challenges in some international markets, bulls see significant potential for growth as the company refines its global strategy. The partnerships with NATO and the UK’s NHS demonstrate Palantir’s ability to secure high-profile contracts outside the US, which could serve as a springboard for further expansion. 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosure here or remove ads . As awareness of AI technology grows globally and Palantir adapts its offerings to meet local market needs, the company could tap into a vast international customer base. Success in key international markets could not only drive revenue growth but also diversify Palantir’s revenue streams, reducing its dependence on the US market and potentially justifying its premium valuation. SWOT Analysis Strengths: Leadership position in AI-powered data analytics Strong relationships with government agencies Proven ability to deliver complex, mission-critical solutions Robust financial performance with accelerating revenue growth Improving profitability metrics and strong cash flow generation Weaknesses: High valuation relative to peers and historical averages Challenges in international market expansion, particularly in Europe Reliance on a relatively concentrated customer base High stock-based compensation impacting GAAP profitability Opportunities: Expanding adoption of AI across industries and government sectors Potential for new use cases and applications of Palantir’s technology International market expansion, particularly in Europe and Asia Strategic partnerships to enhance market presence and product offerings Threats: Intensifying competition in the AI and data analytics market Potential changes in government spending priorities Regulatory challenges related to data privacy and AI ethics Macroeconomic uncertainties impacting client spending on technology Analysts Targets Cantor Fitzgerald: $110 (May 6th, 2025) Wedbush: $140 (May 6th, 2025) Morgan Stanley: $98 (May 6th, 2025) Mizuho: $94 (May 6th, 2025) RBC Capital Markets: $40 (April 29th, 2025) Loop Capital: $141 (February 19th, 2025) Jefferies: $60 (February 19th, 2025) BofA Global Research: $125 (February 4th, 2025) Baird: $70 (December 12th, 2024) D.A.

While the company’s strong financial performance and strategic positioning in the AI market have fueled optimism, concerns about valuation and long-term growth sustainability persist. As Palantir expands its reach and continues to innovate, its ability to balance growth with profitability will be crucial in determining its future success and market valuation. 3rd party Ad.

(NASDAQ: PLTR ), maintaining an Outperform rating and a price target of $140.00. Currently trading at $123.31, InvestingPro analysis indicates the stock is trading above its Fair Value.
